👋 Hi, I'm Garrison! Welcome to my GitHub!

👓 I love React/Typescript and have experience in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS... The list goes on!

🏠 I’m a software engineer at Neighbor

I'm a problem-solver and a decision-maker. I choose to do the most important things, even if they are hard. I am a triathlon runner and I love the outdoors. Coding is my passion which led me to start my career in software engineering!
