👋 Hi, I'm Garrison! Welcome to my GitHub!

👓 I'm a full stack developer, but I especially love newer frontend tech like Remix and Next.js. I have professional experience in Ruby on Rails, Golang, Remix, Typescript, Docker, Kubernetes... The list goes on!

🏠 I’m a software engineer at Neighbor

I'm a problem-solver and a decision-maker. I choose to do the most important things, even if they are hard. I am a triathlon/marathon runner. I love the outdoors. Coding is my passion which led me to start my career in software engineering!
